TreeConv
========
This Program takes bootstrap trees as input and generates a descesion tree on the basis of unique bipartition matrix
The depth of tree tells us the convergence level of bootsrap run.

Instructions

Step1: Rename bootstrap tree file as "tree.nex"
Step2: Run Rscript Matrix.R
Step3: Run python MatrixCol.py
Step4: Run python ID3call.py

(Number of attribute displayed in the tree - 1) is the total depth.
